{% extends 'admin/object_history.html' %}{% comment %}

    This file is selected by default to display polymorphic mptt object history.
    When using reversion or reversion-compare, this template could be replaced
    with the proper {% extends "reversion/object_history.html" %} template.
    Hence, the breadcrumb code is in a separate include file.

{% endcomment %}

{% block breadcrumbs %}{% include "admin/polymorphic_tree/object_history_breadcrumbs.html" %}{% endblock %}
