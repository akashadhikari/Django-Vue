Thanks for downloading Django MPTT

To install, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``mptt`` directory
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
PYTHONPATH; this is useful if you're working from a git checkout.

Requires:
 - Python 2.7 or newer
 - Django 1.8 or newer

You can obtain Python from https://www.python.org/ and Django from
https://www.djangoproject.com/
